# Lending Library App

## Overview

The Lending Library App is a full-stack application developed as a class project for "CS444: Programming for the Web" at Binghamton University during the Spring 2024 semester. It features a React frontend, an Express backend, and a MongoDB database.

- **Frontend:** Built with React to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Developed using Express to handle API requests and business logic.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used for persistent data storage, enabling efficient management of book records and patron book checkouts/returns.

This project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies to create a functional and user-friendly lending library system.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application.
- `backend/`: Contains the Express backend application.

## Purpose

This application serves as a practical example of integrating a frontend and backend in a web development context. It demonstrates skills in full-stack development, including API design, database management, and user interface design.


## Setup

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
